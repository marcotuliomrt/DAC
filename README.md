## Materials used:
-	Nucleo F103RB
-	Mbed environment (to develop the code) 
-	Mbed library 
-	3x push buttons (to control de outputs of the DAC)
-	3x 10K resistors (for the pull buttons)
-	1x oscilloscope (to test the wave formats and frequencies)


## About the DAC - digital to analog converter
It is a 8-bit DAC that can generate 3 wave formats, square, triangular and sinusoidal, and the hardware follows a R-2R topology.
The hardware simulation was done on the software Proteus:
